Before you look at the assignment, I have referenced some code from these websites:

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp

Code is also very bulky and many things can be made smaller. 
But as I have many tasks to complete within a limited time, I have rushed the presentation making it very simple. 
If I had more time I can make this website better.
I have also understood how to implement slideshow and model(PopOut) from this task.
With help from a Dear Friend.
